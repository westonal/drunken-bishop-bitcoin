# drunken-bishop-bitcoin
An adaption of drunken bishop to create small colour images from public bitcoin addresses.

See [drunken-bishop](https://github.com/westonal/drunken-bishop) for the ASCII based implementation as intended and the [original whitepaper](https://github.com/westonal/drunken-bishop/blob/master/drunken_bishop.pdf).

Public bitcoin addresses are not fast to distinqhish or compare. A couple of differences in the middle of the string when the strings are not side by side is easily overlooked.

Drunken Bishop provides a way to create an image which, like a hash, will look very different if even a small change is present.
